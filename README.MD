### Neural Arabic Text Diacritization
##  RE-PRODUCTION OF NLP PROJECT

#   Original Paper Tilte: Neural Arabic Text Diacritization: State of the Art Results and a Novel Approach for Machine Translation
#   Use Google Colab to Run the Source Code: https://colab.research.google.com/
Uploading the first Python source code to Google Drive in order to avail the source code script to the public 

#Requirements List to be installed during the preparation phase

#pip install keras==2.2.5

#pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.15.4

#pip install git+https://www.github.com/keras-team/keras-contrib.git

#pip install matplotlib==2.1.0

#pip install sklearn==0.0

#pip install python-bidi==0.4.0

#pip install arabic-reshaper==2.0.15

Then,

 1- You should access google COLAB to run the source code.

 2- Drag & Drop a file called [ RNN_basic.ipynb ] from your local drive to the google COLAB [ UPLOAD ] located in the First Dialog box shown 
    for selecting the notebook or creating a New Notebook form.

 3- Under the default folder [ /content ] Copy all files listed under the folder [ 1_RNN Training Model ].

 4- Run the Code step by step till the [ OUTPUT.TXT ] file gets created.

 Then

 Do the Same for the next phase by copying the files stored in [ 2_RNN Comparison Process ] to the same folder [ /content ] in COLAB.

 5- Drag & Drop a file called [ DER-WER.py ] from your local drive to the google COLAB [ UPLOAD ] located in the First Dialog box shown 
    for selecting the notebook or creating a New Notebook form.

 6- Run the Code to get the comparison results.
